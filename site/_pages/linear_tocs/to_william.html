“My lost William” (“To William Shelley”) was written in response to the death of the Shelleys’ son William in Rome on June 17, 1819, at the age of three-and-a-half. It was given the title “To William Shelley” when it was first published by MWS in <em>Posthumous Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley</em> in 1824. It was almost certainly composed in Florence during November 1819, when PBS was planning a monument for William’s grave.
