  <div class="intro-text"><p>The virtually reconstituted Notebook C1 below is one of several (probably eleven) small soft-covered notebooks in which the Shelleys prepared fair copy for a three-volume version of <em>Frankenstein</em> to send prospective publishers and, ultimately, the printer. Of British origin, the notebook contained fair copy for the beginning of Volume III, Chapter 5 through a part of Chapter 7, ending in the midst of Victor’s arctic pursuit of the Creature. This portion of the fair copy was written sometime between mid-April and late May 1817, according to Charles E. Robinson’s <a href="contents/frankenstein/frankenstein-chronology/"><em>Frankenstein Chronology</em></a>.</p>
  <p>Notebook C1 was disbound to serve as printer’s copy. It originally consisted of 24 leaves (48 pages) of which 6 leaves are now missing. The remaining 18 leaves now comprise Bodleian <a href="/contents/ms_abinger_c58">MS. Abinger c.58</a> (formerly designated Dep. 534/2), folios 1r-18v. The bibliographical details of Notebook C1, including paper, watermarks, inserts, and quiring charts, can be found in Charles E. Robinson’s <a href="/contents/frankenstein/the-frankenstein-notebooks-introduction/"><em>The</em> Frankenstein <em>Notebooks</em>, pp. xlv-xlviii</a>.
