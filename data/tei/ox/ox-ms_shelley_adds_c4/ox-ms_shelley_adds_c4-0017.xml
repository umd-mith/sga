    <line>In the 1st place the word <unclear>Gk: atheos</unclear> does not mean atheist. It's literal</line>
    <line>translation is "godless" and its accepted meaning among the Greeks</line>
    <line>was "an impious person". - it was a mere term of reproach &amp;</line>
    <line>revilement. Atheist on the contrary expresses a person who</line>
    <line>denies certain opinions concerning the cause of the Universe. It</line>
    <line>expresses neither blame nor praise but simply defines an opinion</line>
    <line>Thus all those persons who deny that this great system</line>
    <line>one</line>
    <line>of things was arranged by <del rend="strikethrough">an</del> intellectual being, in the</line>

    <line><del rend="strikethrough"><unclear> </unclear></del> such portions of it as are submitted to their power, are</line>
    <line>called Atheists. All the Greek philosophers until the</line>
    <line>time of Anaximander were in this sense Atheists &#8212; Very many</line>
    <line>afterwards held opinions within this definition. Aristotle can</line>
    <line>hardly be called a Theist. <del rend="strikethrough">Epicurus was</del> Diogenes, Theodorus</line>
    <line>Diagoras Epicurus were determined Atheists. Pyrrho Carneades</line>
    <line>and the later Academics ?d<unclear></unclear>oubted less questionable points of</line>
    <line>doctrine. The ecletic <del rend="strikethrough">Cicero</del> &amp; dubious Cicero balances</line>
    <line>the arguments. It is the <del rend="strikethrough">the</del> last insolence in the adocates</line>
