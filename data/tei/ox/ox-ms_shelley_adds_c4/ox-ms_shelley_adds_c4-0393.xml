    <line>To write the Wandering Jew. A Novel or the Sisters. - An</line>
    <line>essay on the depravations of Love.</line>
    <line>The wisest of the moral philosophers have justly remarked that man is the</line>
    <line>willing victim of innumerable errors, the habitual slave of a thousand</line>
    <line>perverse propensities. The madness of ambition &amp; the abject idiotism</line>
    <line>of slavery, the impudence of imposture &amp; the ignorance of credulity</line>
    <line><del rend="strikethrough"><unclear>     </unclear></del></line>
    <line>have furnished inexhaustible themes for the indignant reprobation</line>
    <line>of enlightened virtue. Moralists have contented themselves</line>
    <line>however, with tracing these evils to the defective institutions of</line>
    <line>human society. They have shewn that the narrow &amp;</line>
    <line>malignant passions which have turned man against</line>
    <line>man, as a beast of blood, the unenlightened brutality</line>
    <line>of the multitude &amp; the profligat<del rend="strikethrough">e</del>e selfishness of courts</line>
    <line>are <del rend="strikethrough">cherished</del> by errors which have been <del rend="strikethrough">cons</del> rendered</line>
    <line>venerable by antiquity <del rend="strikethrough">&amp; consecrated by custom</del>. This</line>
    <line>however is a loose &amp; superficial estimate of the case.</line>
    <line>These pernicious institutions derive their <del rend="strikethrough">erro</del> origin from</line>

    <line>of internal organization which modify their operation.</line>
    <line>It is surprising that philosophers have never been induced</line>
    <line>of human beings</line>
    <line>to ascribe much of the violent &amp; unreasonable conduct to</line>
    <line>diseased organization. They admit the influence of body</line>
