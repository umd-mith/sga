                        (<abbr>SGA</abbr>) project and described in this document is intended to
                    support the creation of diplomatic edition by providing an XML format for
                    electronic transcriptions which reproduce a set of key characteristics of the
                    original, physical documents as faithfully as possible. The goal of
                    transcription is to accurately describe the state of the physical materials

                    control system to manage all files associated with transcriptions created for
                    the project. Since SGA is using Git, we also use <ref
                        target="https://github.com/">Github</ref>, a hosted service for Git projects
                    which incorporates many useful project management features, to manage the
                    transcription and encoding workflow. The rest of this section briefly describes
                    how to use Git and Github to prepare transcriptions for the Archive.</p>

                <p>You will need: a web browser, the <term>oXygen</term> XML editor, and a Terminal
                    window or Git client (e.g., <term>Github for Mac</term>)</p>

                    <item>Visit the Github page for the Shelley-Godwin Archive data and navigate to
                        the <ref target="../assets/img/issues_tab.png">Issues tab</ref>.</item>
                    <item>Select an open issue from the list to work on. Each ticket represents a
                        page to be transcribed.</item>
                    <item>Assign the issue to yourself using the <ref

                            issue title</ref>. Add a comment to the issue to indicate when you
                        started working. For example <q>Started transcription on 2012-02-13.</q>
                        (Using machine readable dates is a nice convenience for us scanning the logs
                        so please try to remember to use them.)</item>
                    <item>The issue ticket has a link to the page image you can use for
                        transcription and to the stub TEI file for that page image that has already
                        been created.</item>
                    <item>You may want to open the page image in a browser window but don't open the

                        right in the web interface using the <q>Edit this file</q> button. All you
                        need to do is add a &lt;desc&gt; element describing the content, e.g. "Front
                        cover." Otherwise, follow the instructions below.</item>

                        that's the active branch.</item>
                    <item>Create a branch to hold your work. You could name this anything you want,
                        but for convenience, name your branch with your Github username and the

                <p>As you work, please take advantage of Git as a version control system to help
                    you. You can (and should) commit frequently and even push to the remote copy of
                    your branch. This is akin to saving your work.</p>

                <p>A note on git commits and commit messages. A commit is like a snapshot of your
                    working directory. If you can think about your work in relatively atomic kind of
                    units this will help guide you in understanding when or how often to commit.
                    When you commit, Git will ask you to supply a short message describing the
                    changes you're committing. For your own benefit later on as well as for the sake
                    of everyone else on the project who might be trying to review your work, please
                    make your commit messages concise but descriptive.</p>

                        the command: e.g.,

                        in your local copy of the repository. Specifically you will need to delete
                        the branch you made above. To do this, you will need to be on the master
                        branch. Then make sure your copy is up-to-date by issuing:
                            <code>$git&#xa0;pull</code>. Finally, delete the branch both locally and
                        in the remote copy of the repository:
                            <code>$git&#xa0;branch&#xa0;-d&#xa0;trevormunoz&#8209;0001</code> (this

                <p>SGA's model assumes that the transcription of a single physical page of source
                    material is contained in a separate XML file. The project provides a custom
                    schema for validating these page-level transcription files for the convenience
                    of encoders and reviewers.</p>
                <p>A complete SGA document is a TEI-conformant XML document in which a single
                        <tag>sourceDoc</tag> represents a physical item and contains all the
                    information from transcriptions of pages from that item.</p>

                    <p>There are a couple high-level features about this document to note. First,
                        the <att>ulx</att>, <att>uly</att>, <att>lrx</att>, and <att>lry</att>
                        attributes define the coordinates of the upper-left and lower-right corners
                        of the surface (in pixels). These values will be supplied when the TEI stub
                        file is created as part of pre-processing of images before transcription
                        begins. Second, the <att>partOf</att> attribute is provided to link a
                        page-level transcription with the item to which it belongs. Supply the value
                        of the <att>xml:id</att> of the appropriate <tag>sourceDoc</tag> element.

                        hierarchy of <q>a text</q>. </p>
                    <div xml:id="surfaces">
                        <head>The <tag>surface</tag> element</head>
                        <p>The outermost element in a page-level transcription file is
                                <tag>surface</tag>, which represents the page being transcribed.</p>
                        <p>Within <tag>surface</tag>, if the page is blank (contains no writing or
                            marking at all), a <tag>desc</tag> element will be supplied, providing
                            an alternate description of the page, e.g., <q>Front pastedown.</q>
                            There will always be at least one <tag>graphic</tag> element within
                                <tag>surface</tag>, which provides a link to the facsimile image of
                            that page.</p>
                        <p>A surface (presuming it is not blank) will contain one or more
                                <tag>zone</tag>s. These elements are used to describe specific
                            regions within a page. If the writing is not linear within a zone, e.g.,
                            a marginal note or some kind of metamark, the content can be transcribed
                            directly within zone.</p>

                        <head>Dividing a page into zones</head>
                        <p>There are a couple of project-specific conventions for dividing pages
                            into zones. By convention, page numbering or similar kinds of notes
                            occurring at the top of a page should be placed within their own zone,
                            and this should be the first zone on the page. If the content is not
                            linear, then transcribe directly inside the <tag>zone</tag> element.</p>
                        <p>Also by convention, <tag>zone</tag> containing the main block of text on
                            a page should precede any <tag>zone</tag>s used to transcribe content in
                            page margins or other distinct regions.</p>
                        <p>You do not need to worry about creating identifiers for zones or adding
                            descriptive attributes to record their placement on the page. This
                            information will be supplied by coordinates when the transcriptions and
                            page images are linked.</p>
                        <p>SGA does use <att>@type</att> on <tag>zone</tag> with a controlled list
                            of descriptive values such as <q>top</q>, <q>pagination</q>,
                            <q>main</q>, etc. These are most for the benefit of processing tools and
                            are secondary to the coordinates for positioning a zone with respect to
                            the page it appears on.</p>

                            be used to record topographic lines of writing on the physical document
                            (these are different from verse lines, etc.).</p>

                        <p>While the project's focus is on representing the physical documents, the
                            online presentation will also include clean, <q>reading texts</q> so it
                            is necessary to have mechanisms for reconstructing the hierachy of
                                <q>the text</q> apart from its physical support. For this purpose,
                            SGA uses <tag>milestone</tag> elements as well as several
                            project-specific attributes.</p>
                        <p>To record a major structural division in the text, e.g., a line group,
                            paragraph, or div, the use of <tag>milestone</tag> is most appropriate.
                            The value of the <att>unit</att> attribute should be the qualified name
                            of a TEI element, so tei:div. For phrase-level elements, a number of
                            attributes are supplied to indicate what textual structure should
                            correspond to lines of the text. These attributes are:
                                <att>el-target</att>, which stands for <q>target element</q>;
                                <att>att-target</att>, which stands for <q>attribute target</q>
                            meaning attributes which should be part of the target element being
                            created; and <att>att-value</att>, which indicates the intended value of
                            any attributes supplied. These workarounds are necessary because XML
                            enforces a single document hierarchy and does not permit overlap.</p>
