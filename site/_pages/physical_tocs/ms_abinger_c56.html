  <div class="intro-text"><p>Bodleian MS Abinger c.56 (formerly designated Dep. 477/1) consists of 62 leaves originally bound in Notebook A, one of two now disbound notebooks in which Mary W. Shelley (MWS) drafted the two-volume version of <em>Frankenstein</em>. The draft in c.56 runs from the beginning to the end of Volume I, concluding just as the Creature is about to begin his tale to Victor. The pages of c.56 can be accessed in three different sequences: (1) in their current physical sequence below; (2) in their order within a virtually reconstituted <a href="/contents/frankenstein_notebook_a">Notebook A</a>; and (3) in the <a href="/contents/frankenstein/#oxford_frankenstein_volume_i">linear sequence</a> of the the two volume draft. For bibliographical details about c.56, see the introduction to <a href="/contents/frankenstein_notebook_a">Notebook A</a>. For the S-GA overview of the composition of <em>Frankenstein</em>, see our <a href="/contents/frankenstein/">Introduction</a>.
