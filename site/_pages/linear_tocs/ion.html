  <div class="intro-text"><p>Shelley's translation of Plato's <em>Ion</em> was first published in 1840 by Mary Shelley in <em>Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments</em>. Shelley probably began his translation in late 1819 but did not end until sometime in 1821, even then leaving it in what Mary Shelley described as “imperfect” condition.</p>
  <p>An intermediate draft for <em>Ion 530a1-535c3</em> can be accessed below in the linear sequence of the translation itself, or in the physical page order of the notebook in which it appears: <a href="/contents/ms_shelley_e1">Bodleian Manuscripts Shelley e.1</a>. </p>
